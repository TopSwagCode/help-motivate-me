# Commercial Licensing

This project is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License
v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).

## When You Need a Commercial License

While AGPL-3.0 allows commercial use, it requires that any modifications
made to the software and used over a network must also be released under
AGPL-3.0.

If you would like to:

-   Offer this software as a paid hosted service without releasing your
    modifications
-   Bundle this software into a proprietary or closed-source product
-   Distribute a modified version without complying with AGPL-3.0
    requirements
-   Obtain a warranty or commercial support agreement

You may obtain a separate commercial license.

## How It Works

As the copyright holder, the author offers this software under dual
licensing:

-   **AGPL-3.0** --- for open-source use under its terms\
-   **Commercial License** --- available upon request for alternative
    terms

A commercial license allows you to use the software without being
subject to AGPL-3.0 obligations.
