# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: 2026*

This project is built around a simple principle:

**Your data belongs to you.**

This document explains what data is stored, how it is used, and how
AI-related usage is handled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Principles

-   No tracking cookies
-   No third-party analytics
-   No advertising trackers
-   No selling of user data
-   You can delete your data at any time
-   AI features are optional

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Data Is Stored

When you create an account, the application stores:

-   Your account information (email, authentication details)
-   Your habits, identities, goals, journal entries, and related content
-   Settings and preferences
-   Push notification subscriptions (if enabled)

This data is stored securely in the application database and is only
used to provide the service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Authentication

Authentication uses secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management.

No tracking cookies are used.

OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.) are only used for authentication
and do not grant access to your activity data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## AI Features (Optional)

AI-powered features are optional. You can use the application without
interacting with AI at all.

When you use AI features:

-   Your input is sent to the configured AI provider (e.g., OpenAI) for
    processing.
-   Only the data necessary to generate a response is transmitted.
-   AI requests are not used for advertising or profiling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## AI Usage Logging

To ensure sustainability and prevent excessive operational costs, the
system logs limited metadata about AI usage.

This includes:

-   The user making the request
-   Timestamp of the request
-   Token usage or request size
-   Estimated cost of the request

This data is used solely to:

-   Enforce per-user usage limits
-   Monitor overall system usage
-   Prevent abuse
-   Keep infrastructure costs under control

AI usage logs are **not** used for behavioral tracking, profiling, or
marketing purposes.

The content of AI prompts or responses is not used for analytics or
resale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analytics

There are no third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics)
embedded in the application.

Basic internal metrics may be collected for operational purposes (e.g.,
error logging, system health), but these are not used for user profiling
or advertising.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Deletion

You can delete your account and associated data at any time through the
application.

When deleted:

-   Your personal data is permanently removed from the primary database.
-   Associated content (habits, journal entries, etc.) is deleted.
-   AI usage records linked to your account are removed or anonymized,
    where applicable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Sharing

User data is never sold.

Data is only shared with third-party services when required for
functionality, such as:

-   Email delivery (SMTP provider)
-   AI processing (when AI features are used)
-   Push notification infrastructure

These providers only receive the minimum necessary data required to
perform their function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Security

Reasonable technical and organizational measures are implemented to
protect user data against unauthorized access or misuse.

However, no system can guarantee absolute security.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated as the project evolves. Significant
changes will be reflected in the repository.
