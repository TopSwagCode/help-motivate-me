Hi. I have for ages had idea of building my own personal habit tracker / motivational app. Last year I finished my prototype and used it personally on my own machine. I thought to my self that I wanted to make it public. But before I do so I want peoples feedback outside my own friend / family bubble :D So thats why I am here looking for early beta testers. If it's not allowed just delete this post.

There is no money involved other than the money I am loosing hosting it :P
There is no tracking, google analytics, data harvesting of any kind and all data will be erased again.
There is no company behind it. It's 100% my own, homemade hobby project, I am trying to share.

About me:
38 year old software developer from Denmark, who has worked has worked with web development, mainly enterprise software for big companies.
I have a girlfriend who I have been with for 13 years. We have a lovely son, dog and a cat.

I would love people to just spend some time with the project. Give some feedback on what you liked, what you didn't like. Ideas on improvements, etc.

Context about the website / webapp:

I have included some screenshots. But in general it's about building your identity, not just making goals and habits. Eg. if you want to be a marathon runner, you should do stuff that nudges you in that direction.

So in the app, you can create identities, of what you want to become. You can create habit stacks, to make better habits. You can add goals and tasks that can be linked to your identities.

Besides that there is a social element, that you can create journal posts. These post is shared with your "Accountability buddies". People you can invite to see your progress. These people will also be able to write in your journal and root for you. Journal is very basic containing just text and up to 5 pictures. So you can share a picture of your morning run. Maybe picture of your healthy dinner or whatever progress you make :)

This has really just been a love project I have had going for ages and this is the first time I have shared it publicly anywhere. Like there is only 5 people who knows this exists :D So kinda exited to share it and hope I will get some feedback.

If your interested write here on the post or contact me directly in chat message. I am trying to keep signup limited, since I am actively loosing money on it as it is right now. Also expect there to be bugs or things that acts strange.

feel free to ask questions :)
