I want to have admin / user roles. User is default role. Admin has extra Admin page he can see and on this page we get overview of these system as whole. There is a list of active users with their current subscription / membership tier. There is basic stats like number of tasks created, updated, completed today. There is basic information about total number of users and split into tiers. These new endpoints are only allowed to be called by admin role user.
