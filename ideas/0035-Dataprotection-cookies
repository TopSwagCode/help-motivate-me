Here’s a short, clear implementation plan without code, focused on using SQL + multiple app instances:

⸻

Plan: Keep users logged in across restarts and multiple instances
	1.	Use a shared key store
	•	Configure ASP.NET Core Data Protection to store its keys in a shared SQL database.
	•	Reuse the same database you already use for EF Core.
	2.	Ensure all app instances share identity
	•	Set the same application name for Data Protection on every instance.
	•	Use the same authentication scheme and cookie name everywhere.
	3.	Make authentication cookies persistent
	•	Issue persistent cookies so logins survive browser restarts.
	•	Set a reasonable expiration period and enable sliding expiration if desired.
	4.	Deploy safely
	•	Use rolling deployments so at least one instance is always running.
	•	Do not delete or reset the Data Protection key table during deployments.
	5.	Avoid breaking changes
	•	Do not change the application name, cookie name, or auth configuration between deployments.
	•	Keep system clocks in sync across servers.
	6.	Validate
	•	Log in on one instance.
	•	Restart or deploy the app.
	•	Confirm the user remains authenticated across instances.

Result
	•	Users stay logged in across restarts and deployments
	•	Authentication works seamlessly with multiple app instances
	•	No dependency on sticky sessions or load balancer affinity

If you want, I can also provide:
	•	A deployment checklist
	•	A risk checklist (what causes forced logouts)
	•	A short architecture diagram (text-based)
