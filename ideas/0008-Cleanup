AiBudgetExceededException is thrown from the service layer, but the API currently doesn’t appear to map this to a dedicated HTTP status (e.g., 429/403) or a consistent error payload. As-is, this is likely to surface as a generic 500 in non-streaming endpoints and an unstructured SSE error in streaming endpoints. Consider handling this exception explicitly (controller-level catch or global exception middleware) and returning a stable error contract.
