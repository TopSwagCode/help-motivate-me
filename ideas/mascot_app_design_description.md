# App Visual Design Description (Mascot‑Driven UI)

## Overall Design Style
The app has a **warm, cozy, friendly UI** built around a soft mascot aesthetic. The visual language is calm, approachable, and reassuring — never sharp, cold, or corporate. The interface feels **gentle, rounded, and human**, with generous spacing and soft contrasts.

The design should evoke:
- Calm productivity  
- Emotional friendliness  
- A sense of “take your time, you’re doing okay”

---

## Color Palette
The palette is derived from warm, natural tones:

- **Primary color:** soft caramel / warm light brown  
- **Background:** creamy off‑white / warm beige (never pure white)  
- **Secondary accents:** muted sage green and soft olive  
- **Text:** dark cocoa brown instead of black  
- **Highlights / active states:** gentle green or slightly darker caramel  

All colors are **low‑saturation**, warm, and easy on the eyes.  
Avoid harsh contrast, neon colors, or pure black.

## Top App Bar / Header
The top app bar is **soft, rounded, and visually grounded**:

- Full‑width bar with **rounded bottom corners**
- Warm gradient or subtle texture using caramel and beige tones
- Slight depth using a **very soft shadow**
- Mascot icon or logo subtly integrated (corner or center)
- Rounded, friendly typography with medium weight
- No sharp dividers or hard borders

The header should feel like a **gentle container**, not a rigid toolbar.

## Footer Navigation / Bottom Bar
The footer navigation is **pill‑shaped and soft**, floating slightly above the bottom edge:

- Light beige background with rounded top corners
- Rounded, filled, slightly chunky icons
- Active item highlighted with a soft pill or glow effect
- Inactive items remain muted and calm
- Subtle elevation to separate it from content

Navigation should feel **friendly and touch‑inviting**, not mechanical.

## Shapes & Layout Language
- Cards and panels use **large border radii**
- No sharp corners anywhere in the UI
- Generous padding and whitespace
- Sections feel like soft cards on a cozy surface
- Dividers use spacing or subtle gradients instead of lines

---

## Typography

- Slightly playful but highly readable
- Friendly, welcoming headlines
- Calm body text with comfortable line height
- Avoid ultra‑thin or overly bold extremes

---

## Iconography

- Consistent stroke weight
- Simple, friendly shapes
- Visual harmony with the mascot’s style

---

## Motion & Interaction
- Slow, gentle animations
- Soft easing curves
- No snappy or aggressive motion
- Warm, subtle hover and active states

---

## Overall Impression
The app should feel like:

> “A cozy, friendly place that gently helps you get things done.”

The mascot and UI feel like they belong to the same world.
