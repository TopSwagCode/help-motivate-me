Next feature I want to work on is onboarding flow for first time users log's in / just signed up.

As part of it we want to make tasks, goals, identity reuseable across pages and also make it so onboarding can be done as part of single onboarding wizard that takes you through everything you need getting started.

It should be a multi step wizard you go through in the following order:

1: Identity - With short intro to what identity is and how it's. Take inspiration from the indenties page.
2: Habit stacks - Again short intro to Habit stacks.
3: Goals and tasks.

When onboarding is complete have user redirected to "today" page with popup / overlay saying welcome with massive confetti exploxation in background / animation. Have a short intro text to this page, that this is where your daily overview is and where you can keep track of your daily tasks, habits and how your progressing against your goals / identities. This overlay / popup is a one of deal for first time users only.
