# Contributing

First of all --- thank you for considering contributing to this project.

This project is built with a strong focus on privacy, transparency, and
user ownership. Any contribution should align with those principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Philosophy

Before contributing, please keep in mind:

-   User data belongs to the user
-   No hidden tracking or analytics
-   No dark patterns
-   AI features must remain optional
-   Simplicity over feature bloat

If a feature conflicts with these principles, it is unlikely to be
accepted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

-   Reporting bugs
-   Improving documentation
-   Suggesting UX improvements
-   Submitting pull requests
-   Improving accessibility
-   Refactoring or performance improvements

Even small improvements are welcome.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Before Opening a Pull Request

1.  Open an issue first for significant changes.
2.  Explain the problem and your proposed solution.
3.  Wait for feedback before implementing large features.

This helps avoid duplicated effort and ensures alignment.

## Development Guidelines

-   Keep code readable and simple.
-   Prefer clarity over cleverness.
-   Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
-   Do not introduce tracking, telemetry, or analytics.
-   Ensure AI-related features remain clearly optional.
-   Maintain user data deletion guarantees.

If your change affects privacy or data handling, clearly document it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code Style

-   Follow the existing style and patterns in the repository.
-   Keep pull requests focused and minimal.
-   Include tests if applicable.
-   Update documentation when necessary.
