You will receive an acknowledgment as soon as possible.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please allow reasonable time to investigate and resolve the issue before
publicly disclosing it.

If the vulnerability is confirmed:

-   A fix will be prioritized.
-   A security advisory may be published.
-   Credit will be given to the reporter (unless anonymity is
    requested).

## Scope

This policy applies to:

-   The backend API
-   The frontend application
-   Authentication flows

-   Data storage and deletion mechanisms

Issues related to third-party providers (OAuth providers, AI provider,

## Security Principles

This project is built with:

-   Minimal data collection
