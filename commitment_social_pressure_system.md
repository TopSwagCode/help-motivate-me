# Commitment & Social Pressure System
## Motivation Through Promises — Not Punishment

Inspired by StickK

---

## Core Idea
We are more likely to act when someone else is counting on us.

This system increases follow-through by making commitments **visible, intentional, and socially anchored**, while preserving autonomy and psychological safety.

---

## 1. Commitment Contracts

### Description
A self-chosen agreement where the user commits to completing a task or habit within a defined scope.

### UX Flow
1. User selects a task or habit  
2. Taps **Make a Commitment**  
3. Defines:
   - Duration (1 day / 7 days / custom)
   - Minimum effort (tiny habit rule)
   - Witness (self / partner / group)
4. Confirms commitment

### Example
> “I commit to writing 1 sentence every weekday for the next 7 days.”

### Motivation Mechanism
- Converts intention into a psychological contract  
- Increases perceived cost of inaction without punishment

### Safety Design
- No penalties by default  
- Commitments are editable  
- Auto-expire to avoid long-term pressure

---

## 2. Accountability Partners

### Description
A trusted person who can see your commitment progress.

### Partner Types
- Close friend  
- Teammate  
- Coach  
- Anonymous accountability buddy (optional)

### Visibility Controls
- Can see completion status  
- Can send encouragement  
- Cannot see missed task details

### Motivation Mechanism
- Social expectation  
- Desire for consistency  
- Gentle external awareness

### Safety Design
- No leaderboards  
- No comparison  
- One-tap pause accountability

---

## 3. Public or Private Pledges

### Description
A declaration of intent that can be private, shared with a group, or public (opt-in only).

### Examples
- Private: “This week, I’m prioritizing my health.”  
- Shared: “I’m committing to daily walks — cheer me on.”  
- Public: “30-day writing challenge”

### Motivation Mechanism
- Identity reinforcement  
- Consistency bias

### Safety Design
- Public pledges are time-boxed  
- No public failure notifications  
- Full visibility control

---

## 4. Gentle Check-In System

### Description
Supportive follow-ups when commitments are missed.

### Example Prompts
- “Want to adjust this commitment?”  
- “Was the task too big?”  
- “Do you want to pause or reduce it?”

### Motivation Mechanism
- Reflection instead of guilt  
- Maintains engagement after setbacks

### Safety Design
- No negative language (fail, broke, quit)  
- No red alerts or penalties

---

## 5. Exit With Dignity

### Description
A graceful way to step away from a commitment without emotional penalty.

### Exit Reasons
- This no longer fits my priorities  
- I overestimated my capacity  
- I want to restart smaller

### Motivation Mechanism
- Reduces fear of commitment  
- Encourages future recommitment

### Safety Design
- Exit is private by default  
- No historical penalty  
- Focus on learning

---

## 6. Commitment History

### Description
A log of commitments made, not just completed.

### Metrics
- Commitments attempted  
- Completion rate  
- Adjustments made  
- Lessons learned

### Example Insight
> “You follow through best on 7-day commitments with small tasks.”

### Motivation Mechanism
- Builds self-trust  
- Rewards effort over perfection

---

## Design Principles
- Consent over pressure  
- Support over punishment  
- Visibility over comparison  
- Learning over streaks
